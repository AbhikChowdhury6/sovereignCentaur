#passses in a microphone array
#use realitve intensity to isolate sound sources based on location #direction, sound level
use odas for this
#run a similar unsupervised clustering system on the sounds #type ID
get michaels help with figuring out how to encode this data
#classify sound sources based on weather there is speaking or not label Type ID to speaking
get michaels help with this classifier
#encode a speech event with the metadata // direction, intensity
return the odas info for this and normalize with absolute orientation
#explore unstructured clustering methods to derive useful metadata 
use a techniqe similar to step 2
#classify speech event with a person identifier
techiqe similar to step 3
#transcribe speech to text for NLP
use deep speech streaming


# store all of this data raw for later mining


#ask questions to fill in HRM attributes

#basic NLP pipeline
    #what's your name?
    #where are you from?
